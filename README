This is a C++ library for driving MCC DAQ devices on Linux.  

Download and install libusb
	-http://www.libusb.org/
	-./configure --prefix=/local/dir/libusb-built/
	-make
	-make install
	
	-NOTE: 	The existing installation of libusb on the APS RedHat machines did not work for us, although future updates
			may fix that. Changes to the Makefile and source files would be necessary to use the system installation though.

Set environment variables for libusb
	-setenv PKG_CONFIG_PATH libusb-built/lib/pkgconfig
	-setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:libusb-built/lib

Make daqflex
	-Change the FILENAME define in main.cpp to wherever you would like the output file to be located
		NOTE: choose a local location, it doesn't seem to write well to network drives
	-Change the LIBUSB_PATH variable in the Makefile to point to your local installation of libusb (libusb-built folder)
    -Device settings such as scan rate and channels selection can also be set in variables in main.cpp
	-make

If you run the daq executable on a machine without any elevated permissions, you will receive an insufficient permissions error.  This is because libusb needs elevated permissions to access the USB port correctly.  To solve this, ask IT to give you sudo permissions on the daq executable.
